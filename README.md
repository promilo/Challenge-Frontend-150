# Code-Challenge-WEB
My attempt for igloo front end code challenge 150.

## Assumption
I am assuming that "page size should be 5" means that I can only allow users to generate 5 rows of members.

Hence at the 5th click of the button "load more" the button color change to red and the text would change to "Max out"

## Libraries
-jquery because it makes it easier Ajax Calls and DOM manipulation

## Here were the instructions I was given for this coding Challenge.s
1. Clone this repo to your local development environment
2. Refer to the design mock-ups while developing the home page [Design Assets](https://github.com/IglooSoftware/Code-Challenge-WEB-Members/tree/master/assets)
3. Start your work in the index.html file
4. Bind an event to the *load more* button within `js/main.js` to trigger an API call that will retrieve and display the next collection of members from the mock API service provided by [Randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me). Page size should be 5 and ajax calls should leverage the provided apiClient loaded from `js/apiClient.js`.

Remember: In implementing a design, attention to detail is key (*container sizes, positioning, fonts, etc.*)

You can use libraries but in your submission, you must include the reasoning for using the libraries.

You can make assumptions in your submission as well but the assumptions must be documented in your submission as well as the reason that assumption was made and what that affected.
